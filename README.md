* Save the code to following path /mininet/custom  
* Run by using this command sudo mn â€“custom <python file name.py>  --topo= network
 ### Before DoS:
* We have considered file name as *beforeddos.py* and class name as *project*
 ### After Dos:
 * We have considered file name as *afterddos.py* and class name as *project*

 ## CAPTURING DATA ON WIRESHARK
 * Open wireshark using sudo wireshark from terminal
 * Click on Capture, select interfaces you want to monitor the traffic 
 * Start capturing the packets by giving pingall in mininet console
 * Once pingall is completed, export the file to csv
 
 ## DDOS ATTACK
 * To launch ddos attack we have selected the ten nodes with highest degree and turned them off for about 25 minutes
 * In order to launch ddos attack we have removed following nodes: *160,155,164,193,181,192,179,156,184,182*
