# VISUALIZING THE INTERNET ARCHITECTURE PROJECT
## REQUIREMENTS
PYTHON3 (Python-3.10.2 used)  
JUPYTER NOTEBOOK (Jupyter notebook 6.4.5 used) 
## Division of Nodes
* Considered k valus as 5
* Each team member has worked on nearly 250 nodes
* Bhavana Kucharlapati -- from node id 5000 to 5249 -- network_security_1.ipynb(notebook name)
* Kavya Konisa -- from  node id 5200 to 5449 -- network_security_2.ipynb
* Venkata Revanth Kollipara -- from  node id 5400 to 5649 -- network_security_3.ipynb
* Viswanth Boyina -- from  node id 5600 to 5849 -- network_security_4.ipynb
*  Srija Pullakhandam -- from  node id 5800 to 6049 -- network_security_5.ipynb
## IMPORTING OF NOTEBOOK
* Open Jupyter Notebook  and upload **network_security_Number.ipynb**.
*  **Number** values lies in between 1 to 5  

## INSTALL PACKAGES
You'll also need to run the following commands to install some required packages.  
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 
 ```
## RUN THE CODE  
* Open **network_security_Number.ipynb** in Jupyter notebook  
* Run the cells line by line  

## TO VIEW THE OUTPUT

* The output consists of a dense network graph which can be zoomed in and out. The node size depends upon the degree of a node.
* Inorder to view the output, hover over each node. While hovering it displays Source id, No. of connections, Neighbour node id's.

## HISTOGRAM PLOT

The histogram was plotted for 192,244 nodes and their degrees. The x-axis represents the node degree and the y-axis represents the count of nodes that falls in particular degree range. For better plotting used log function on the count scale due to the high count of nodes.
